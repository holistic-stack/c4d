Variable declaration and assignment
==================

a = 1;
$fn = 50;
name = "OpenSCAD";
r = [0:1:10];

(source_file
  (var_declaration (assignment name: (identifier) value: (number)))
  (var_declaration (assignment name: (special_variable (identifier)) value: (number)))
  (var_declaration (assignment name: (identifier) value: (string)))
  (var_declaration (assignment name: (identifier)
    value: (range start: (number) increment: (number) end: (number)))))

==================
Let expression and let block
==================

let (a = 1, b = 2) a + b;
let (c = 3) cube(c);
